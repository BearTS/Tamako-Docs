You can use ```t!mguide``` to get a guide on counter setup <br/>
Use ```t!mhelp``` to get help related to counter system

## Create/edit a counter

Counters are placed by writting them in a channel name or topic, if something is between
two curly braces ( {} ), Member Counter will considere it a counter, and it will update it in
the next 5 minutes <br/>

You can place counters in one of the following places:
* In a **voice** channel **name**
* In a **category** channel **name**
* In a **text** channel **topic**
* In a **news** channel **topic**

For this example we are gonna use `{members}` , which counts the total amount of
members in your discord server, you will find out more counters below

Create a new channel, or/and edit it, and write `{members}` in the name or topic, and click
'save changes'<br/>

<img src={require('../assets/member_counter_1.png').default} /><br/>

Then, wait at least 10 seconds, and Member Counter will update it:<br/>

<img src={require('../assets/member_counter_2.png').default} /><br/>

You can also add multiple counters in one name/topic, and combine them with your own content, here is a example:<br/>
<img src={require('../assets/member_counter_3.png').default} />


> If you reach the character limit when you are editing a name/topic, please check t!help editChannel. You can see the current counter configurations with t!seeSettings, this is useful to add more counters without disabling the previous ones


## Remove A Counter

Edit the channel and write `{disable}` in the name/topic, Member Counter will replace it to a âœ…, that means that you removed all the counters of that channel successfully<br/><br/>
You can also delete the channel directly

## Preview counters
Instead of waiting to see how will be the final result, you can use ``t!preview`` to check how will look your custom counters in a chanel name or topic
```
t!preview {onlineMembers} of {members} Online
```

## Displaying large counts

<img src={require('../assets/member_counter_4.png').default} /><br/>

Use ```t!mshortNumber``` when the counts are too large<br/>
You can also choose to show from 0 to 3 deciamls<br/>
**Usage**
```
t!mshortNumber enable
t!mshortNumber 0
t!mshortNumber 1
t!mshortNumber 2
t!mshortNumber 3
t!mshortNumber disable
```

<img src={require('../assets/member_counter_5.png').default} />

```
t!mcounts
```

## Allow Roles to execute these Commands

```
t!mrole [allow/deny] [@roles/all]
```
Where the first parameter is the action (allow or deny) and the second parameter is on
which roles you want to perform the action, it must be role mentions (@ plus the role name
and/or use the discord autocomplete) or the ``all`` keyword, which will applies the change
to all the roles

**Examples**
```
1 t!mrole allow @Mod
2 t!mrole allow @Mod @OtherRole
3 t!mrole deny all
```

<img src={require('../assets/member_counter_6.png').default} />
